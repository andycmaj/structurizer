# Structurizer
Structurizer is extracted from one of my other projects [PineCone](https://github.com/danielwertheim/pinecone), which was used for much of the underlying indexing stuff for another project of mine, SisoDB. Structurizer is reduced to only manage a key-value representation of an object-graph.
